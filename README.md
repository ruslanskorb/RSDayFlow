# DayFlow

iOS Date Picker + Infinite Scrolling.

## Play

Look at the [Sample App](https://github.com/evadne/DayFlow-Sample). Check out the [Sample Video](http://vimeo.com/evadne/dayflow-debut). Have fun. Make it faster. Fork and send pull requests. Figure out hooks for customization.

## Use

Plop `DFDatePickerViewController` in, and implement the one method in `<DFDatePickerViewControllerDelegate>`:

	- (void) datePickerViewController:(DFDatePickerViewController *)controller didSelectDate:(NSDate *)date;

That pretty much sums up what it does.
